The objective of this project is to use image classification, image segmentation, and object tracking to automate the process of identifying cube load percentage and opportunities for improved packing efficiency in real-time. 
During the trailer loading process, there are 4 pictures taken with various capacity (0%, 25%, 75%, 100%). Currently the pictures are manually reviewed to determine which service centers require proper trailer loading procedures. Real time image classification to identify poor loading practices is needed so that the company could prevent package damages from occurring and save the company money by reducing claims. 
Use proper image classification, image segmentation, and object tracking to provide product damage detection, increased packing optimization, and autonomous trailer loading. The 3 primary use cases are: 
Establish the percentage utilization by volume.
Understand packing efficiency to improve operations
Identify opportunities for protecting freight for damage
Some of the barriers in developing automated solutions are:
Image quality issues (brightness, resolution).
Image consistency (angle).
Closely packed shipments being mistaken as an individual unit.
Packing materials being mistaken as a shipment instead of protective support.
